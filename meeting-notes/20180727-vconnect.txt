add check box to Sampler

add publisher must support element and search - bring it up

fix publisher value in Questionnaire

if have both options for reference need way to know which search param to use.  do we constrain out identifier?

groupings or categorization of patients. or demographic profiles.

Use Patient and context to create link to patient to encounter to originating System.

Use separate mechanism for sorting and group

sub-population of patients.

contained patients - may be minimal patient demographic and not identifiers.

for searching and slicing and dicing.

Use Case 1 QR in trusted environment vs Use Case 2 non-trusted environment - anonymized.

This is the reason for prepop forms with demographic information. or add the items to
Q - how is sliced and diced is out of scope.

More than willing to expose in the answer bank.

answer bank with PHI needs access control.  see security section.

encounter should be 0..1 -  fixed


Language considerations - are different languages same questionnaire url and id
  no add http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/translation to all the elements in need of translation for end User
  make example.
     elements =  1) item.text when not hidden display  1) question type.

Need to add the non hidden display stuff to QRs.
