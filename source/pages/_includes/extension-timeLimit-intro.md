**Implementation Guidance:**
To determine whether the questionnaire or items were answered within the time limit defined by the extension, the Form Filler can record the start and stop date-times in the [Argonaut QuestionnaireResponse Response Period Extension]. How this information modifies the behavior of the Form-filler or interpretation of results is an implementation detail outside of scope of this Implementation Guide.
