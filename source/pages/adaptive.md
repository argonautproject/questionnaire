## Introduction

The Argonaut Questionnaire Implementation Guide defines a series of interactions which cover the basic workflow for the creation, discovery and retrieval of "computer adaptive forms" using FHIR Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse and the FHIR API.

- Dynamic forms
   - Adjust what questions are asked based on previous answers
- Logic defined external to Questionnaire
- Iteratively submit response to API (FHIR operations)
- Locally Questionnaire/QuestionnaireResponse updated on the fly
- Record total score as an Observation
